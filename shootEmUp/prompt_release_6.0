v0.1********************************************

mplement the complete enemy progression system, Elite Shooter rules, spawn caps, player life, and difficulty alerts for the Canvas shoot ’em up game.

1️⃣ Player Life

Initial life: 5

Existing extra-life mechanics remain unchanged

2️⃣ Enemy Spawn Rate & Density
Rushers & Shooters

After 100 kills: spawn rate increases

After 300 kills: no more normal Rushers or Shooters

Spawn rules:

Shooters obey upper-half screen restriction

Rushers follow normal movement rules

Early Game Density Caps:

Kills < 5 → max 2 enemies on screen

Kills < 10 → max 5 enemies on screen

3️⃣ Elite Shooter Rules
Pre-100 Kills: Regular Elite Shooter

Spawn frequency: every 30 kills

Max on screen: 1

Behavior:

Random movement

Shooting modes: rapid-fire bullets + Rusher spawn

Rewards: power-up + extra life

HP scaling: based on player power levels

150–299 Kills: Regular Elite Shooter

Spawn frequency: every 30 kills

Max on screen: 3

Behavior: same as pre-100 rules

Rewards: power-up + extra life

Post-300 Kills: Dual Elite System
Type A — Replacement Elites

Spawn condition: replace Shooters

Behavior: move like normal Shooters (vertical from top or horizontal in upper half)

No random movement, no shooting modes, no Rushers

Rewards: none

Number on screen: unlimited

Type B — Original Elite Shooter

Spawn condition: every 30 kills (as pre-300 rules)

Behavior: random movement + shooting modes

Rewards: power-up + extra life

Number on screen: unlimited

4️⃣ Difficulty Alerts (On-Screen Messages)

After 100 kills:

Display large text at bottom: "The enemies are getting angrier!!!"

After 150 kills:

Display: "More angry Jelly are coming"

Post-300 kills:

Display: "Behold! Here is the real Angry Horde!"

Display style: large, prominent, temporary but noticeable, does not block gameplay


Design Constraints

Maintain modular logic for:

Type A vs Type B elites

Spawn frequency scaling

Max elite counts per stage

Alerts are non-blocking, rendered on bottom of canvas

Rushers spawned by Type B elites follow original rules

Player collision, power-up, and extra-life logic remain unchanged

Enemy density caps for early game (<10 kills) still enforced

Spawn positions respect upper-half screen restriction for horizontal spawns

7️⃣ Output Requirements

Update all enemy spawning, elite logic, max counts, and difficulty alerts

Briefly explain:

How max simultaneous elites are enforced per stage

How Type A and Type B elites are differentiated

How difficulty alert messages are triggered and displayed

How spawn rate scaling and enemy caps are applied

v0.2 ***********************************************************************
1️⃣ Entering Debug Mode

Activation:

Game is paused

keyboard enter d then Enter on keyboard

Debug mode toggles on/off

2️⃣ Debug Mode Features

On-screen indicator

Display text: "DEBUG MODE"

Position: top-right corner

Blinks or flashes to be noticeable

Player Invincibility

While debug mode is active: player cannot take damage

Blink / invincibility logic does not interfere

Manipulate Enemy Kill Count

While in debug mode:

Typing a number + Enter sets the current enemy kills to that value

This triggers enemy progression rules immediately (spawn rates, elite spawning, difficulty alerts, etc.)

3️⃣ Design Constraints

Debug mode cannot break existing gameplay loops

All changes are instant but reversible (toggle off to resume normal behavior)

Debug input only active while paused

Maintain all existing collision, power-ups, and elite rules

Visual debug text should not interfere with other UI elements

4️⃣ Output Requirements

Update only pause menu / input / debug logic

Briefly explain:

How debug mode toggling is implemented

How player invincibility is enforced

How number + Enter updates enemy kill count

v0.3****************************************************************************************
Prompt — Difficulty Alert & Debug Mode Polishing (Canvas Shoot ’Em Up)

Update difficulty alerts and debug mode behavior for better gameplay clarity and testing safety.

1️⃣ Difficulty Alert Tweaks

Display duration: 2 seconds (instead of previous shorter flash)

Color: bright red (clearly visible against game background)

Position: bottom of the screen (unchanged)

Behavior:

Triggered at kill thresholds (100, 150, 300) as previously defined

Multiple alerts do not overlap; new alert replaces previous if still on screen

2️⃣ Debug Mode Scoring Rules

High score exclusion:

When debug mode is active, the current session does not affect high score tracking

Once debug mode is deactivated, normal scoring resumes

Other debug features remain unchanged:

Player invincibility

Flashing "DEBUG MODE" indicator on top-right

Typing number + Enter changes enemy kills

3️⃣ Design Constraints

Alerts must remain non-blocking and not interfere with other UI or gameplay

High score system must ignore debug-mode kills without affecting stored normal high score

All other gameplay mechanics, collision, and progression remain unaffected

4️⃣ Output Requirements

Update only difficulty alert display logic and debug mode scoring logic

Briefly explain:

How alert flash timing and color are applied

How debug mode is excluded from high score

v0.4 ******************************************************************************************
1️⃣ Power-Up Core Visuals

Each power-up should visually consist of three layered elements:

A. Glowing Blue Aura (Outer Layer)

A circular blue glow surrounding the power-up

Glow should:

Pulse / blink continuously (smooth fade in/out)

Be slightly larger than the pickup itself

Use semi-transparent blue (rgba with alpha)

Implement using:

Canvas shadow blur, OR

Animated alpha value over time

B. Power-Up Body (Middle Layer)

The power-up itself is a colored cube

Cube color depends on category:

Bullet amount → distinct color

Damage → distinct color

Bullet speed → distinct color

Cube should:

Slightly rotate or bob vertically

Stay centered inside the glow

C. Gold Dollar Sign (Top Layer)

A gold $ symbol rendered on top of the cube

Color:

Gold / yellow (#FFD700 or similar)

Style:

Slight outline or shadow for readability

Always facing the camera (no rotation)

Position:

Centered on the cube

Drawn last so it’s always visible

2️⃣ Animation Requirements

Glow:

Pulses continuously (sin / cosine or timer-based)

Cube:

Gentle floating motion OR slow rotation

All animations:

Time-based (not frame-based)

Independent of game speed or pause state (pause freezes animation)

3️⃣ Design Constraints

No gameplay or drop-rate logic changes

Power-up hitbox remains unchanged

Effects must be lightweight (Canvas-friendly)

Works for all three power-up categories

Clear visibility even during heavy combat

4️⃣ Output Requirements

Update only power-up rendering logic

Briefly explain:

How glow pulsing works

How cube + dollar sign layers are drawn

How animations are paused when game is paused

v0.5**************************
change power ups to rectangle shape with pulse effect and exiting distinct color logics. on top of the rectangle, have write text "Power Up"
change text power up to yellow color
text is still black, is this due to black backgriund interference?
now make the rectangle of the power ups larger
