v0.1********************************************

mplement the complete enemy progression system, Elite Shooter rules, spawn caps, player life, and difficulty alerts for the Canvas shoot ’em up game.

1️⃣ Player Life

Initial life: 5

Existing extra-life mechanics remain unchanged

2️⃣ Enemy Spawn Rate & Density
Rushers & Shooters

After 100 kills: spawn rate increases

After 300 kills: no more normal Rushers or Shooters

Spawn rules:

Shooters obey upper-half screen restriction

Rushers follow normal movement rules

Early Game Density Caps:

Kills < 5 → max 2 enemies on screen

Kills < 10 → max 5 enemies on screen

3️⃣ Elite Shooter Rules
Pre-100 Kills: Regular Elite Shooter

Spawn frequency: every 30 kills

Max on screen: 1

Behavior:

Random movement

Shooting modes: rapid-fire bullets + Rusher spawn

Rewards: power-up + extra life

HP scaling: based on player power levels

150–299 Kills: Regular Elite Shooter

Spawn frequency: every 30 kills

Max on screen: 3

Behavior: same as pre-100 rules

Rewards: power-up + extra life

Post-300 Kills: Dual Elite System
Type A — Replacement Elites

Spawn condition: replace Shooters

Behavior: move like normal Shooters (vertical from top or horizontal in upper half)

No random movement, no shooting modes, no Rushers

Rewards: none

Number on screen: unlimited

Type B — Original Elite Shooter

Spawn condition: every 30 kills (as pre-300 rules)

Behavior: random movement + shooting modes

Rewards: power-up + extra life

Number on screen: unlimited

4️⃣ Difficulty Alerts (On-Screen Messages)

After 100 kills:

Display large text at bottom: "The enemies are getting angrier!!!"

After 150 kills:

Display: "More angry Jelly are coming"

Post-300 kills:

Display: "Behold! Here is the real Angry Horde!"

Display style: large, prominent, temporary but noticeable, does not block gameplay


Design Constraints

Maintain modular logic for:

Type A vs Type B elites

Spawn frequency scaling

Max elite counts per stage

Alerts are non-blocking, rendered on bottom of canvas

Rushers spawned by Type B elites follow original rules

Player collision, power-up, and extra-life logic remain unchanged

Enemy density caps for early game (<10 kills) still enforced

Spawn positions respect upper-half screen restriction for horizontal spawns

7️⃣ Output Requirements

Update all enemy spawning, elite logic, max counts, and difficulty alerts

Briefly explain:

How max simultaneous elites are enforced per stage

How Type A and Type B elites are differentiated

How difficulty alert messages are triggered and displayed

How spawn rate scaling and enemy caps are applied

v0.2 ***********************************************************************
1️⃣ Entering Debug Mode

Activation:

Game is paused

Press Enter on keyboard

Debug mode toggles on/off

2️⃣ Debug Mode Features

On-screen indicator

Display text: "DEBUG MODE"

Position: top-right corner

Blinks or flashes to be noticeable

Player Invincibility

While debug mode is active: player cannot take damage

Blink / invincibility logic does not interfere

Manipulate Enemy Kill Count

While in debug mode:

Typing a number + Enter sets the current enemy kills to that value

This triggers enemy progression rules immediately (spawn rates, elite spawning, difficulty alerts, etc.)

3️⃣ Design Constraints

Debug mode cannot break existing gameplay loops

All changes are instant but reversible (toggle off to resume normal behavior)

Debug input only active while paused

Maintain all existing collision, power-ups, and elite rules

Visual debug text should not interfere with other UI elements

4️⃣ Output Requirements

Update only pause menu / input / debug logic

Briefly explain:

How debug mode toggling is implemented

How player invincibility is enforced

How number + Enter updates enemy kill count
