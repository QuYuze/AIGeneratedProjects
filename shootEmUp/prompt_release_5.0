v0.1************************************************

xtend the game with progressive enemy behaviors and enemy types to balance increasing player power.

The system must be kill-count driven, deterministic, and compatible with the existing power-up system.

Enemy Types Overview

Uses standard bullet logic

After firing twice, must switch modes

Mode 2 — Rusher Spawn

Spawns 2 Rushers

Spawned Rushers:

Appear near the Elite Shooter

Are stunned for 1 second

Do not move during stun

After stun, follow normal Rusher rules

After spawning Rushers twice, must switch modes

Rewards & Effects
Elite Shooter Defeat Rewards

When an Elite Shooter is destroyed:

Guaranteed power-up drop

Grant +1 extra life

Display screen message:

Text: “EXTRA LIFE!!!!!”

Position: Top of the screen

Style: Blazing / visually emphasized (simple text effects only)

Assets & Visual Rules

Player, Shooter, and Horizontal Shooter:

Use assets from the existing assets/ folder

Rusher:

Green placeholder asset

Elite Shooter:

Orange placeholder asset

No animations required

No sound effects required

Architecture Constraints

Enemy progression must be driven by total enemies destroyed

Enemy spawning logic must be centralized

Do not hardcode thresholds inside enemy classes

Elite logic must not block normal enemy spawning

Reuse collision, rendering, and update loops

Explicitly Exclude

Boss phases

Timers outside of the 1-second rusher stun

New UI systems beyond the extra-life message

Complex pathfinding

Output Requirements

Update only necessary files

Briefly explain:

How enemy progression tiers are calculated

How Elite Shooter mode switching is enforced

How Elite HP scales with player power

v0.2******************************************************************
Prompt — Enemy Spawn & Elite Gating Logic Update

Extend the existing enemy progression system with elite gating rules and spawn position constraints.

This prompt modifies spawning logic only and must integrate cleanly with the current enemy system.

Elite Shooter Gating Rules
Single-Elite Constraint

At any time, only one EliteShooter may exist on screen

If an Elite Shooter is alive, no new Elite Shooter may spawn, even if kill thresholds are met

Elite Respawn Logic (Important)

When an Elite Shooter is destroyed:

Record the enemy kill count at the moment of death

The next Elite Shooter may spawn only after 30 additional enemies are destroyed

This rule applies regardless of the current total kill count

Example:

Elite dies at 67 kills

Next Elite may spawn at 97 kills

Not at 90, even though 90 is a multiple of 30

Enemy Spawn Position Constraints
Shooter & Horizontal Shooter

Shooters must never spawn in the lower half of the screen

Applies to:

Vertical spawns (top-down)

Horizontal spawns (left/right)

Valid spawn region:

Upper 50% of the canvas only

Rusher Spawn Constraints

Rushers spawned normally or by Elite Shooter:

May spawn anywhere specified by their rules

Are not restricted by the shooter upper-half rule

Implementation Notes

Elite spawn tracking must be state-based, not frame-based

Use explicit flags / counters:

eliteAlive

killsAtLastEliteDeath

Do not rely on modulo math for Elite spawning

Spawn position clamping should be centralized in the spawner logic

Explicitly Exclude

UI changes

Balance tweaks

Spawn animations

Difficulty scaling changes beyond this logic

Output Requirements

Modify only enemy spawning logic

Briefly explain:

How elite respawn timing is enforced

How spawn bounds are applied consistently

v0.3******************************************************************
Prompt — Fix Invincibility Blink & Extend Duration (Canvas)

Refactor the player hit / invincibility system to fix movement during blinking and extend the invincibility period.

Requirements

Movement during invincibility

While the player is blinking (invincible), player movement must remain fully responsive

Do not block or freeze update or render logic

Blink effect should be purely visual (toggle opacity or visibility)

Invincibility Duration

Extend the invincibility period to 3 seconds

Ensure the timer starts immediately after the player is hit

Ensure collision logic correctly ignores damage only during this period

Blinking Effect

Maintain the current blinking pattern

Do not let the blink “stick” or pause the player

Continue rendering bullets, movement, and other gameplay updates normally

Design Constraints

Keep invincibility and blinking logic separate from movement logic

Avoid introducing global delays or setTimeout that freeze gameplay

Timer should be frame-based or delta-time-based, not blocking

Keep code modular for easy adjustments of duration or blink frequency

Output Requirements

Update only player / collision / invincibility logic

Briefly explain:

How movement remains active during invincibility

How the blink effect is applied without affecting gameplay

How the 3-second duration is enforced

v0.4***************************************************************
Prompt — Limit On-Screen Enemies Based on Kill Count (Canvas)

Refactor the enemy spawning system to limit the number of enemies on screen depending on the current total kills.

Requirements
Enemy Count Caps

Current kills < 5

Maximum 2 enemies may be present on screen at any time

Current kills < 10

Maximum 5 enemies may be present on screen at any time

Current kills ≥ 10

No artificial cap (existing progression rules apply)

Applies to all normal enemies (Shooters, Horizontal Shooters, etc.)

Do not affect Rushers or Elite Shooter spawns (they follow separate rules)

Implementation Notes

Centralize enemy count check in the spawn manager or update loop

New enemies spawn only if total enemies on screen < cap

Spawn logic must respect:

Enemy types

Spawn bounds (upper half of the screen)

Elite / Rusher rules

Ensure cap checks update each frame so enemies are allowed as old ones are destroyed

Design Constraints

Do not block gameplay updates

Keep code modular — caps should be easy to adjust

Avoid magic numbers inside enemy classes — use constants

Output Requirements

Update only enemy spawning logic

Briefly explain:

How the on-screen cap is enforced per kill threshold

How it integrates with existing enemy progression rules

v0.5**********************************************************************
Prompt — Elite Shooter Movement & Rapid-Fire Update (Canvas)

Refactor the EliteShooter behavior to improve AI movement and shooting while keeping all other progression and spawn rules unchanged.

Requirements
1️⃣ Movement Update

Current: Elite Shooter is stationary

New: Elite Shooter moves randomly across the entire canvas

Movement is continuous and smooth

Can reach any part of the canvas, including the bottom half

Avoid collisions with canvas boundaries

Must not interfere with Elite Shooter attack mode timing or spawning logic

2️⃣ Shooting Mode 1 Update

Current: Fires 1–2 bullets per mode

New: Rapid-fire sequence

Fires 10 bullets in quick succession

Very short cooldown between each of the 10 bullets

After 10 bullets fired, a 3-second cooldown before next Mode 1 sequence

Mode switching rules remain:

After Mode 1 fires twice, switch to Mode 2 (spawn Rushers)

Bullet behavior otherwise remains unchanged

3️⃣ Shooting Mode 2

No changes

Continue to spawn 2 Rushers per activation, with 1-second stun before they start moving

4️⃣ Design Constraints

Movement logic must not block rendering or player interaction

Shooting logic must remain frame-rate independent

Maintain existing HP scaling, mode alternation, and reward logic

5️⃣ Output Requirements

Update only Elite Shooter movement and Mode 1 firing logic

Briefly explain:

How random movement is handled safely across the canvas

How the rapid-fire sequence and cooldown are implemented

How Mode 1/Mode 2 alternation remains consistent

v0.6*************************************************************
Prompt — Shooter Stop Shooting at Lower Screen Zone (Canvas)

Update the behavior of normal enemies (“Shooters”) so that they stop shooting when they descend below a certain vertical threshold.

Requirements

Behavioral Change

Shooter enemies continue moving as usual

Stop firing bullets once their y-position reaches the lower 25% of the canvas

Movement and collisions remain unaffected

Threshold Definition

Lower 25% of canvas = y >= canvas.height * 0.75

Shooting should resume only if they move back above the threshold (if ever applicable)

This ensures enemies near the player do not spam bullets

Design Constraints

Do not affect other enemy types (Elite Shooter, Rusher, Horizontal Shooter)

Keep shooter AI modular — only shooting logic is conditionally disabled

No new global variables; use per-enemy state

Output Requirements

Update only Shooter update / shooting logic

Briefly explain how the shooting condition is applied based on y-position
