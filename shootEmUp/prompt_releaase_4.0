v0.1****************************************************
Implement a power-up system where power-ups are category-based pickups that increase player ability levels, with progress-based level caps and probability-controlled drops.

Core Concept (Important)

Power-ups themselves have no levels

Each power-up belongs to one of three categories

Picking up a power-up increases the corresponding ability level by +1

Ability levels are capped by game progress

Power-Up Categories & Effects

There are three power-up categories:

Bullet Amount (Spread)

Each level adds +2 bullets

Bullets fire in a cone spread

Bullet Damage

Each level increases bullet damage by +50

Bullet Speed

Each level increases bullet speed incrementally

Each category has a maximum of 3 ability levels.

Progress-Based Ability Level Caps

Ability levels are limited by enemy kill progress:

Progress Tier	Enemies Destroyed	Max Ability Level
Tier 1	≥ 2	Level 1
Tier 2	≥ 30	Level 2
Tier 3	≥ 100	Level 3

A player cannot increase an ability beyond the currently unlocked progress tier.

Drop Eligibility Rules

When an enemy is destroyed:

Determine the current progress tier based on total enemies destroyed

Build a list of eligible power-up categories:

Ability level for that category is below the progress-based max

If no categories are eligible, no power-up can drop

Otherwise, a power-up may drop, based on drop probability

⚠️ Important:

A category stops dropping if its ability level has reached the current progress cap

Other categories can still drop if they are below the cap

Drop Probability

If at least one category is eligible:

Progress Tier	Drop Chance
Tier 1	20%
Tier 2	10%
Tier 3	5%

Roll once per enemy death

If the roll succeeds, randomly select one eligible category

Power-Up Entity Behavior

Power-up spawns at the enemy’s death position

Power-up falls downward slowly

On player collision:

Increase the corresponding ability level by +1

Clamp to progress-based maximum

Remove the power-up entity

Gameplay Integration

Bullet behavior must update dynamically based on ability levels

Ability effects stack incrementally and predictably

No sudden or exponential scaling

UI / HUD Requirements

Display all three ability levels in the top-left corner

Use golden-colored text

Example:

Power:
Spread: 2
Damage: 1
Speed: 3


UI must update immediately on pickup.

Architecture Constraints

Centralize configuration:

Progress thresholds

Drop probabilities

Ability caps

Do not embed drop logic inside enemy classes

Reuse existing collision systems

Keep systems modular and readable

Explicitly exclude:

Temporary buffs or timers

Animations or sound effects

Visual flair beyond basic rendering

Multiple power-up items per pickup

Output:

Update only required files

Briefly explain:

How eligible categories are determined

How progress tier is calculated

How ability levels affect bullet logic
