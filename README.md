This project was built using an AI-first development workflow.

No application code was written manually.

All source code in this repository was generated by AI coding tools.

All prompts were authored or refined using AI chat models.

All README documentation is AI-generated.

The focus of this project is system design, prompt engineering, iteration control, and architectural decision-making, rather than manual typing.
